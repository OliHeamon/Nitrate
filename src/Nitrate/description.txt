Nitrate is a performance optimization mod focused on generalized improvements to many features throughout the game.

Leveraging parallelism, SIMD instructions, GPU rendering, and other optimizations, Nitrate can provide a significant boost in performance.

NITRATE IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT; CERTAIN FEATURES MAY BE ENTIRELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHER MODS WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY. WHILE YOUR SAVES SHOULD BE SAFE, VISUAL DISPARITIES AND CRASHES MAY STILL OCCUR.

General Feature Overview
 * Rewrites and optimizes dust rendering to be done almost entirely on the GPU (may not render or crash with modded dust, needs testing)
 * Parallelizes dust updating
 * Rewrites and optimizes rain rendering to be done almost entirely on the GPU (may not properly render with mods that change the rain texture/color)
 * Parallelizes rain updating
 * Replaces usages of typical FNA types with JIT intrinsic SIMD types in notable hotspots
 * Rewrites tile rendering to be chunk-based and optimizes lighting to be handled partially on the GPU (currently bugged with things like spelunker potions)
